# To-Do List App 📝

This is a simple **To-Do List App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to manage tasks using text-based commands.

## Features 🚀
- View all tasks (`list`)
- Add a new task (`add`)
- Delete a task by index (`delete`)
- Quit the app (`quit`)

## How It Works 🔧
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. A prompt will ask for your request.
3. Use one of the following commands:
   - **`list`** → Displays all tasks.
   - **`add`** → Adds a new task.
   - **`delete`** → Removes a task by index.
   - **`quit`** → Exits the app.

## Future Updates 🔄
I plan to improve this project by:
- Adding a **visual interface** for task management.
- Storing tasks using **Local Storage**.
- Enhancing user experience with **better prompts and error handling**.

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
